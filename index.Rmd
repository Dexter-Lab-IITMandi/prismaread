The goal of `prismaread` is allowing to easily import PRISMA hyperspectral data (http://www.prisma-i.it/index.php/it/) and convert them to a easier to use format (ENVI or GeoTiff).

_`prismaread` is developed and maintained by Lorenzo Busetto and Luigi Ranghetti, 
[Institute of Remote Sensing of Environment](http://www.irea.cnr.it/en/) - National Research Council - Italy (CNR-IREA)_

# Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lbusett/prismaread")
library(prismaread)
```

# Usage

See the __Articles__ section of the website for detailed info on usage. 

- Instructions for importing PRISMA [__L1__](articles/Importing-Level-1-Data.html) and 
[__L2__](docs/articles/Importing-Level-2-Data.html)

- Info about [Output format and Naming Conventions](articles/Output-Format-and-Naming.html)

- Info about [Creation of ATCOR input files](articles/Creation-of-ATCOR-files.html)

- Instructions for extracting PRISMA data over features of a vector dataset [Extracting Data from PRISMA images](articles/Extract-Data.html)


# Future Work

- Test possibility to more properly georeference L1/L2B/L2C data using the curvilinear
grids functionality in package `stars`

- Implement possibility to apply masks based on the ERR_MATRIX cubes

- Clean up code
