Description: `prismaread` allows easily importing PRISMA (http://www.prisma-i.it/index.php/it/) 
 satellite hyperspectral data cubes and ancillary information from the original
 data provided by ASI in HDF format, and convert them to a easier to use format 
 (ENVI or GeoTiff). 
 It also provides functionality for automatically computing Spectral Indexes from
 either the original HDF data or from hyperspectral data already converted using 
 function `pr_convert`, and for easily and quickly extracting data and computing
 statistics for the different bands over areas of interest.
